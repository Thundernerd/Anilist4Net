Hell yeah! An Anilist API for .NET that doesn't suck!

## Reason for creation
I needed an API to get user IDs for [Anime Preview](https://github.com/cainy-a/AnimePreview), but current API libraries kinda suck. Some are missing functionality, and some are almost impossible to use. Neither of the two I found had documentation.

## Aim
Create a nice API for Anilist with documentation, and good ease of use
